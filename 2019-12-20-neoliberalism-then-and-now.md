# Neoliberalism, then and now

*A neoliberal's history of neoliberalism.*

## Neoliberalism in brief

Neoliberalism is, among other things, a political ideology advocating the 
vigorous pursuit of liberal ends with the most effective possible means.
Neoliberalism tends to be more consequentialist and pragmatic than its
progressive or libertarian cousins. As a result it tends to be more empirical
as well. Neoliberalism is reformist with respect to liberalism itself,
seeking to constantly optimize liberal institutions for maximum positive 
impact. In this sense neoliberalism is an ideology of permanent revolution.

## Neoliberalism then

Neoliberalism had three primary phases in the 20th century. The initial phase
began with the Walter Lippman Colloquium and the Mont Pelerin Society, joined
forces to some degree with libertarianism, and ended with the ascendancy and 
eventual stagnation of right-neoliberalism inside the Republican Party in the 
US, the Conservative Party in the UK, and in their various analogous entities 
throughout the English-speaking world during the 1980s. This phase spent 
quite a long time in the intellectual wilderness, only coming to power in the
US bit-by-bit as via the institutions of the Nixon, Ford, and Reagan 
presidencies. Neoliberalism had a much less gradual ascendancy in the UK,
being almost entirely outside the mainstream until it rode into Number Ten
alongside Lady Thatcher's libertarian cavalry. This phase's characteristic 
exponents were Milton Friedman and Friedrich Hayek, though the latter was
prominent mainly among the more philosophically-inclined neoliberal circles.

As neoliberalism was incubating in the Anglosphere, the free half of Germany
had adopted ordoliberalism, an ideological cousin of neoliberalism, as its
state ideology, a model which was followed by the Nordic states shortly
thereafter. This more communitarian form of free market liberalism had an
Asian twin in the form of Lee Kuan Yew's Singapore. Other states pursued
liberal policies to one degree or another, but usually because of the need
to access global markets or because of direct imposition by the Anglophone
states. While countries like Japan and South Korea benefited enormously from 
liberalism, it never took hold in the organic way that it did with the 
German Christian Democrats, their Nordic counterparts, or the Singaporean
People's Action Party. 

The second phase of neoliberalism began in the 1980s as dissident factions
of the Democratic Party in the US, the Labour Party in the UK, and in their
various analogous entities across the English-speaking world looked to the
success of neoliberal economic programs being pursued by parties of the right
and began what was a very short process of appropriation. With the Soviet 
Union collapsing and the Anglophone geopolitical framework standing alone,
political factions of all kinds across the globe began to appropriate 
neoliberal economic policies as well. This adoption of liberalism generally
and elements of neoliberalism specifically outside the Anglosphere was due in
large part to the observation that liberal reforms had worked really well 
outside the directly administered domains of the Anglophone hegemony. The 
liberal order was a system in which polities could participate, not a system 
that was only reachable through imposition.

The Western center-left neoliberals enjoyed immediate and dramatic success.
The 1990s saw the Third Way Democrats and New Labour storm to electoral
dominance. Their near complete takeover of the institutions in London and
DC came at the cost of equally rapid co-option by a swarm of interests that
had also learned to speak the language of neoliberalism and who were using
that ability to further usually self-interested and often illiberal aims. As
with so many other political movements, the apotheosis of neoliberalism
sowed the seeds of its eventual undoing. The ideological currents that 
delivered Clinton to the Oval Office were rendered impotent as it became 
clear that the dominant part of his faction was far more committed to 
turning the DC establishment into an open marketplace for influence than 
implementing a serious actual political program.

Serious neoliberalism waxed in other parts of the world as it waned in the 
Anglosphere. Reassured by the German and Singaporean experience, a diverse
array of polities in every corner of the globe began to adopt some form of
neoliberal ideas, and lacking the institutional baggage of more developed 
states they often had less difficulty implementing neoliberal ideas. Nearly 
every polity that reconstituted its social contract with neoliberal ideas 
experienced runaway economic growth due not only due to better access to 
Western capital and technology but also due to better internal rulesets. It 
can be argued that Anglophone neoliberalism's greatest success happened 
entirely outside the Anglosphere, with the neoliberal policy toolkit 
allowing states from China to Chile to reengineer their economies and 
drastically improve the lives of their people as a result. Sadly many of
these newly liberalized countries kept their profoundly illiberal political
systems, and the association of neoliberalism with authoritarian impulses
became a oft-repeated canard on the left, despite having no basis in fact.
The globalization of neoliberalism can be thought of as its third phase,
though it was temporally concurrent with the second.

It was at this moment, Fukuyama's premature "end of history", that 
neoliberalism stood triumphant. Rising rapidly across the globe but with 
cracks beginning to form in its Anglophone base, the word "neoliberalism" 
became an abbreviated way for conspiracy theory-prone leftists and 
progressives to refer to the imagined causative agent behind all the bad
things in the world during Fukuyaman moment. This constructed 
"neoliberalism" was framed as a bourgeois conspiracy seeking to hide any 
number of underlying crises. An entire generation of academics grew up on 
this intellectually lazy and informationally lossy way of referring to the 
bad things about the post-Cold War era. 

Given their propensity to opportunism, the vast majority of Clintonite 
apparatus accepted this constructed narrative and began to couch neoliberal 
policies in progressive language, forming the tradition that center-left 
figures like Barack Obama emerged from in the early aughts. But by accepting 
the left-progressive anti-neoliberal premise, this generation of center-left 
neoliberals found it difficult to generate novel economic ideas that could 
be characterized as neoliberal, instead focusing on the social liberal 
ground that they shared with progressives. This left the maintenance of 
economic neoliberalism to the American center-right, which also rejected 
the neoliberal label largely due to quirks in the American political 
lexicon while retaining many neoliberal ideas under different names. This
also had an unfortunate effect on the perception of neoliberal ideas as 
otherwise conservative economists cherrypicked from the thought of Milton
Friedman, conveniently ignoring things that were very much within his 
political program like the universal basic income or the Georgist land 
value tax.

As most people can now agree, the Fukuyaman moment ended abruptly on 
September 11th, 2001. Its end was sudden mostly because history had never
actually ended. Liberalism's triumph over communism was almost entirely
economic, but it was perceived as a military one largely because of the
various bloody proxy wars that the Western allies either lost or drew to
stalemate. Though the policymaking elite of the West recognized the end
of the Fukuyaman moment in the realm of so-called high statecraft, they
seem to have missed the far more profound end of the Fukuyaman moment in
economics, namely the rise of the internet. This was taken to be merely an
another fruit of the ultimate system of mostly free markets managed by an
energetic but thoughtful regulatory apparatus staffed with the brightest
available people. These institutions remained frozen in basically the same 
form across the Anglosphere from 1998 to 2008, at which point it finally
became apparent that a few politically expedient housing policies of the 
Clinton administration had combined with poorly thought out regulation of 
the financial system to seed a global financial crisis more significant 
than the Great Depression.

The Western central banks were able to prevent truly dire catastrophe by
applying a specifically neoliberal set of tools such that, despite the 
magnitude of disaster, there were no breadlines in the West. The world
rode out the 2008 crisis and the deep recession. Despite the neoliberal
character of the intervention, there were mistakes made, and in some cases
the correct road was politically suicidal and therefore not taken. Despite
a direct role in mitigating the 2008 crisis and the shortening the
recession that followed, neoliberalism found itself once again in the
political wilderness as Barack Obama's administration matured and the last
vestiges of Third Way politics were swept out in favor of progressivism.

The 2008 financial crisis was the beginning of a series of dramatic step 
changes in the nature of Western politics. Political discourse moved from 
the walled garden of broadcast media and print journalism to the noisy 
agora of the internet. State institutions that relied on favorable media
coverage to legitimize their authority began to slip into irrelevance.

## Neoliberalism now

It's impossible to date exactly the beginning of neoliberalism's fourth
and current phase. Identifiably neoliberal discourse on internet forums
goes back to 2009 at least, and formally neoliberal discussion groups 
emerged in the early 2010s. Almost all of this conversation was happening
on the internet, with individuals occasionally grabbing hold of the
discursive thread and pulling it until they reached the work of earlier
phases. This process began in the late 2000s, but gained enormous steam
alongside the twin crises brought about by Donald Trump and Brexit. With
traditional political lines being called into question, the ranks of
self-identifying neoliberals in the Anglosphere swelled by orders of 
magnitude in the space of a few months. People of all major political
backgrounds have found a home in the intellectual core of neoliberal
thought. Neoliberalism has been growing because today's liberals have 
begun to see pervasive rot in the institutions that earlier generations 
built. 

Despite rapid growth from a kernel of philosophically motivated dissident 
liberals to a broader network of formal organizations, meeting groups, 
discussion fora, and thinkers, neoliberalism is still a comparatively
small political movement. The reason neoliberalism punches above its
current light weight is because as discussed above and as stated so
eloquently by Sam Bowman, "a very weak version of this might be the basic 
ideology that underpins the modern world". Indeed, Neoliberal ideas often 
work so well that they fade into the institutional infrastructure and 
become associated with the ideological currents of a given moment, hence 
the conflation of neoliberalism with Fukuyama's "end of history", or with
Thatcherism, or with the prevailing sentiments of the DC mandarin class.
Neoliberalism is characterized by none of these things, but has itself
characterized all of them to varying degrees. 

Up until this point, neoliberalism has gained most of its institutional 
gravity by allowing itself to be appropriated in part by other, often 
dubiously liberal ideological currents. Rightists borrowed elements of 
neoliberalism from its founders, the center-left borrowed from the 
rightists in turn, and the global liberal movement took from all of the 
above to appropriate and localize a collection of neoliberal ideas and 
as a consequence ameliorate poverty for billions. This chimeric quality 
shouldn't be discarded, in fact entryism into a diverse array of political 
movements should be a key objective of today's neoliberals. But there is 
the possibility, however remote, that we might do much, much more than 
what can be accomplished with entryism alone.

## Neoliberalism forever

Neoliberalism, for perhaps the first time since its founding moments, is
finding a voice of its own thanks to the internet, unencumbered by the 
necessity of institutional affiliation that made a neoliberal movement
that sought to operate on its own terms impossible.

If the Bowman thesis holds true and neoliberalism does indeed underpin 
prosperous modernity, neoliberals must exploit that position to become 
the underpinning ideology of the future. If politics moves from physical 
space to digital ether, neoliberals need to be among the first to establish 
themselves in the ether. If global affairs transforms from the playground of 
nation-states to a patchwork of cities and regions in a truly globalized 
order, neoliberals must work towards the best version of that order. If 
liberalism needs constant radical change, liberalism needs neoliberalism.
