# Notes from Catalonia

*This started out as the rough draft of a piece for Exponents Magazine, but 
the length (currently more than 15000 words) and gonzo tone was a bad match 
for the brand. An abridged version will probably make it into Exponents at 
some point. Comments and responses welcome.*

I spent most of fall 2019 in Europe, and most of that time in Barcelona.
Barcelona is the capital of Catalonia, an autonomous region inside Spain
and populated mostly with ethnic Catalans who are culturally separate from
the rest of the region. Catalonia has a history of aspirations to true 
self-rule.

As a consequence of these aspirations, Catalonia and the Catalans who live 
there have been the target of systematic and brutal repression by Spanish 
and French regimes going back centuries. Recent independence agitation 
resulted in a referendum in 2017 which caused a larger constitutional crisis 
in Spain. The crisis has become permanent, with many Catalans rejecting the
authority of the Spanish state outright. Periodic flareups of unrest over 
the last few years have hardened attitudes on both sides of the independence
debate. The largest flareup since the referendum started during my time in 
Barcelona and continues as I post this months later.

What follows is the first in a series of posts that record my observations 
of the situation on the ground and present a framework for analyzing the 
decline of large 20th century nation-states, the rise of small polities, and 
the role that technology is playing in the reordering of global politics.

## Setting the Scene

Hundreds of thousands in the streets, a major international airport put 
out of commission due to sit-ins, a global tourist destination and top tier 
world city undergoing political convulsions. Scenes of public disorder in 
normally placid and prosperous parts of the developed and integrated world 
have become familiar news since the people of Hong Kong took to the streets
this June and proved to the world that popular uprisings are still possible 
in the digital age. Discontented people of every political stripe in every
region across the globe have been watching Hong Kong closely, and over the 
last several months we have started to see the fruits of their study.

The linguistically and culturally distinct autonomous northeastern region 
of Spain known as Catalonia has become a battleground in the increasingly 
global conflict between compact, coherent regional or municipal polities and 
the larger nation-states in which they reside. Years of local 
dissatisfaction with the Madrid government led to a historic and successful 
independence referendum in 2017, an event that precipitated a constitutional 
crisis in Spain, the arrest or flight of the Catalan officers of government, 
and the imposition of increasingly obnoxious state restrictions on 
Catalonian politics by the Spanish security authorities. Most people reading 
this probably know the rough outline of the referendum crisis as it very 
nearly caused a Eurozone-wide financial panic. I won't get into Carles 
Puigdemont and his shadow government in Belgium quite yet, or the specific 
political conditions on the ground. That will come later. For all of this to 
make sense beyond the very shallow-level understanding you might get from TV 
coverage or 500 word hits in major English-language papers, you need to 
understand some basic contextual things about Catalonia, its position in the 
Mediterranean and in Spain, a rough outline of its political and economic 
history, and a few notes on Barcelona, the city where most of this story will 
unfold. 

Barcelona is the cultural, political, and economic capital of Catalonia. It
is also as old as anywhere in Europe other than Neanderthal caves, a jewel of 
the Western Mediterranean since before the time of Rome. Unless you're coming 
to Catalonia from another part of Spain or from the southern part of France, 
you'll probably fly rather than take the train. Barcelona's major suburban 
aviation hub, El Prat, is marginally more efficient than other Southern 
European airports, largely by necessity. 2019 is set to be a record year for 
traffic, and the ratio of flights to available gates is so lopsided that it's 
as common to arrive to or depart from your airplane via bus. At one point I was 
returning to Barcelona after a conference in Berlin. As we were waiting for an 
inexplicably late tow truck to move our plane into its berth, I made a joke 
about the chaos to my most seatmate, a Danish businesswoman. She laughed and 
replied "this is nothing, you should see how bad it is in Spain!".

If you were a 18th century artillery captain the first thing you'd notice 
about Barcelona is the excellent piece of high ground in the middle of the
urban agglomeration. This hill is placed in the very middle of the city, packed
tightly next to the port to the east and the old city to the north, with a view 
directly over the airport as well. This rocky feature is called Montjuïc and
there are at least two local legends involving Hercules and Montjuïc 
specifically, a fact that helps reinforce the ancientness of the place. On top 
of this hill sits an imposing 18th century star fort from which the 
aforementioned 18th century artillery captain and his successors helped the 
Spanish state projected power for centuries. As modern munitions made star forts 
obsolete, the Castel de Montjuïc was transformed into a complex of political 
security police offices and prison cells occupied first by the pre-revolutionary 
Spanish state, then by various revolutionary parties, and finally by the rising 
Franco regime. The hill is littered with competing memorials to the hundreds who 
died there in the first half of the 20th century. A flower garden marks the place 
where Lluis Companys, the last president of a truly independent Catalan state, 
was killed by a Francoist firing squad in as the regime was consolidating power 
in 1939. About a hundred meters away lies an open-air Gothic revival chapel 
dedicated to the Nationalist victims of Republican massacres just a few years 
before Companys was murdered. All this blood makes Montjuïc one of several 
candidates for the title of "Catalan Bastille". A somewhat happier landmark in the 
form of the 1992 Summer Olympic stadium and various related monuments lies down 
the inland slope of Montjuïc, and the cliff facing towards the Mediterranean 
affords a panoramic view of Barcelona's vast port complex, one of Europe's most 
active harbors. Like the adjacent El Prat airport, the Port of Barcelona has seen 
enormous growth in recent years, with 50% more containers passing through in 2017 
than in 2011. The competing Spanish ports of Valencia and Algeciras may be larger 
for now, but with current growth rates Barcelona will be on top of the rankings by 
the end of the 2020s.

As you descend Montjuïc's northeastern slope you enter the Poble Sec neighborhood 
and then reach Avenida Paral·lel, the southern boundary between the Barcelona 
where people live and work and the Barcelona that ends up on Instagram. This area 
is called La Ciudat Vella, "The Old City". Three to six-story buildings are 
divided by streets that are often less than four meters across and crowded with 
as many tourists as locals. Periodically you'll come upon a square or market of 
some kind. One of the larger public squares in this part of the city is the Plaça 
Sant Jaume, site of several large government buildings and the target of regular 
political demonstrations. Going further will put you by the French Station 
railyard and the Parc de la Ciutadella, where the Catalonian parliament sits. Via 
Laietana lies about a block to the northeast. If you follow Via Laietana towards 
the mountains you'll end up in an upscale shopping area near the Plaça Catalunya, 
another focal point of protests, then then through a group of uniform blocks called 
Eixample, and eventually on to Vila de Gràcia, another agglomeration of old-town 
streets, squares, and alleys that was gradually absorbed into Barcelona proper over 
the centuries. If you keep climbing up you'll eventually reach a set of Spanish
Civil War-era bunkers that offer a spectacular, Sim City-like view of the entire
metropolitan area, which includes numerous developed valleys stretching into the
mountains like you'd see in Southern California.

If you climbed back down that route towards the Mediterranean you could look to 
your right, south, in the direction of Valencia, and see first the interior suburb 
of Sants, home of FC Barcelona's Camp Nou stadium, the suburbs of L'Hospitalet de 
Llobregat, and the El Prat airport. Barcelona proper ends roughly around the 
Llobregat river. To your right, north, in the direction of Girona and eventually 
France, lies the expansive commercial district of Sant Martí, home to banks, 
technology companies, European Union offices, and King, the firm that makes the 
mobile game "Candy Crush", among other things. Gaudi's famous church, La Sagrada 
Familia, is a bit inland. The shoreline is ringed with Barcelona's famous beaches. 
It's late autumn, so the main group of people still on the beach are wearing 
wetsuits, holding surfboards, and looking for waves. Following the main road 
northeast will put you first in Poble Nou, then in the affluent neighborhood of 
Besòs along the banks of a river also called Besòs. Beyond that lies the 
industrial parks and suburbs of Badalona.

All of this lies at the center of Europe's sixth most populous region, and the most 
economically productive of the regions controlled by the Spanish state, though the 
equally independence-minded Basque country on the Atlantic coast is richer in 
per-capita terms. Catalonia owes this prosperity to some obvious geographic 
advantages, but also to less obvious institutional ones. Barcelona was the primary 
naval base and trading port of the Crown of Aragon, one of the major late Medieval 
Christian kingdoms from the period before Spanish unification. This meant that 
Catalonia was among the first places in the Mediterranean to industrialize in the 
early 19th century, and a factory in the area was the first in Iberia to sport a 
steam engine. An important piece of context is that Catalonia is one of very few 
parts of Iberia to experiment with laïcité, state secularism in the French sense. 
This has given the animosity around the Spanish Civil War, and the Franco regime in 
particular, a pseudoreligious character.

Depending on who you ask, Catalonia is governed by the Generalitat de Catalunya, an 
autonomous community constitutionally recognized within Spain, or by the Generalitat 
de Catalunya, a sovereign state with its governmental officers mostly imprisoned in 
Madrid or exiled in other parts of Europe. Regardless of the specific formulation, 
the Generalitat has its own police force, the paramilitary Mossos d'Esquadra, a name 
that literally means something similar to "the Squad Guys" or "the Troopers". The 
independent firefighting brigade is known as the "Bombers". The region was 
administratively autonomous even during the period of Aragonese rule and had periods 
of true local rule from time to time. This history of robust state capacity made 
Catalonia one of the primary strongholds of the Republican movement during the 
Spanish Civil War, and consequently the site of some of the worst atrocities on both 
sides.

In theory its inhabitants mostly speak Catalan at home and have a strong command of 
Castillian Spanish for dealing with the those who can't speak Catalan. In practice 
that gets a bit more complicated, and like everywhere in the Latin world people are
speaking more and more English in more and more contexts. Barcelona would still be a 
cosmopolitan world city without the high levels of tourism that it currently enjoys. 
Indeed there's some truth to the idea that Mediterranean port cities like Barcelona 
are where we get the archetype of a cosmopolitan world city in the first place.

The Spanish state in the 21st century is defined by many characteristics and events, 
but none moreso than the original sin of 20th century Spain, its unique position as 
the only major fascist state in Europe to survive the Second World War. The Franco 
regime came into being with the direct support of Nazi Germany and fascist Italy, 
secured power using similarly brutal tools of repression, and consistently reached 
for surveillance, arbitrary detention, machine guns, and garrote wire over more 
pluralistic means of securing the consent of the governed. The Franco regime lasted 
until the 1970s and left a deep scar on the collective political psyche, especially 
in places like Catalonia where the official use of the Castillian dialect was 
rigorously enforced, local cultural expression was violently suppressed, and 
political dissidence meant involuntary disappearance to a state security prison
cell, exile, or a hole in the ground. The Francoist means of government was state 
terrorism in the interest of social control. The Catalan people have many 
grievances with the Madrid government ranging from the allocation of tax revenue, 
the provisioning of social services, neglect of public utilities and critical 
infrastructure and the imposition of needless bureaucracy, but nothing comes close 
to the broadly held view that a unitary Spain under the Constitution of 1978 is a
fascist imposition that works in the interests of a premodern kingdom that nobody 
voted for either. At no point have the people of Catalonia had the opportunity to 
truly run their own affairs for more than a decade or two despite a demonstrated 
ability to do so that stretches back to before Spain even existed. 

It's against this backdrop that the people of Catalonia are asking each other some 
fundamental, constitutional, political questions: If we have a working government 
sitting in Barcelona why must we take orders from Madrid? If Catalonia is 
constitutionally autonomous as it supposedly must be under the present Spanish 
constitution, why are our airports, streets, and internet connections invaded by 
the Guardia Civil? If we live in a free society why are our leaders forced to go 
to prison or hide in Belgium? If the people in Hong Kong can fight with the Chinese 
state and keep going after six months of police violence and the concrete threat of 
another Tienanmen, what do we really have to fear from the Spanish state? How they 
answer these questions will have great bearing not just on the future of Spain or 
the future of Europe, but on the future of politics the world over as the center of 
political gravity shifts slowly from continental concerns to global ones, and from 
nation-states to cities.
