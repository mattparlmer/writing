Most people paying close attention to the rapid spread of 2019-nCoV have resigned themselves to the fact that this pandemic will come with a substantial body count. Unfortunately, the tragedy of this virus's immediate impact on human life is just the beginning of the havoc it could wreak. Obviously lives are at risk, but due to a complex stew of geopolitics the set of highly sophisticated just-in-time global supply chains that rely on PRC manufacturing are in mortal danger as well, and people appear to be wildly underestimating the risks.

The PRC's productive output slowed dramatically in the weeks leading up to the lunar new year celebrations, a weeklong holiday celebrated universally around the Sinosphere. This was an expected annual disruption that was more-or-less priced in by financial markets and the businesses around the world that rely on partners in the PRC to provide material inputs to their own processes. Over the last few days that slowdown has become a violent and unexpected crash.

People who still think that the situation in the PRC is under control should disabuse themselves of that notion. The cities that have been officially quarantined so far by order of the central government in Beijing sit at important rail and road junctions. These closures alone will have a major economic impact, but the reaction that they have sparked in the agrarian and industrial countryside may prove to be even more impactful. The Chinese interior is rapidly shutting down, and not entirely because it has been ordered to do so.

Over the last few days photos and videos have been leaking through the Great Firewall that depict a massive decentralized response to the outbreak, often taking the form of locally managed checkpoints. Communities are self-quarantining because they don't trust the central government to give them accurate information or sufficient medical supplies, both reasonable concerns under the circumstances. A particularly striking set of videos from a Western observer in Shanxi show multiple towns and villages simply turning away cars at makeshift barricades. Shanxi is one of China's primary coal-producing regions.

All across the PRC roads are closed and trucks aren't getting through. Soon the main problem might not be coronavirus, but rather the distribution of basic supplies. The practical effect is similar to a civil war, with every truckload of goods having to negotiate roadblocks and no-go zones managed by a shifting and overlapping cluster of authorities, many of whom won't be talking with each other.

As noted above, this outbreak has gone parabolic at the exact time when a large fraction of the Chinese population is on the road visiting family. This means that when a factory restarts production after the holiday is finished, a substantial proportion of their staff could be hundreds or thousands of kilometers away with no means of quickly returning to their jobs. Furthermore, it's inevitable that some of the people returning from the holiday that many will be infected with coronavirus, triggering the possibility of yet more quarantine. All of this taken together means that China's economy is in the process of hitting a brick wall. The rest of the region could follow soon after.

Mongolia's response to the situation has been to lock the country down entirely by closing the border, limiting transit, shuttering schools for a month, and banning public gatherings. This will undoubtedly limit the available supply of copper, molybdenum, and other minerals which Mongolia produces. What happens when bigger economies like Taiwan, Vietnam, Thailand, or Indonesia take similar measures? The world has come to rely on Asian producers for everything from socks to semiconductors. This crisis has implications that anybody who relies on Asian goods to operate their business will need to deal with as the case count grows and the footprint spreads. If we suddenly lose access to Asian supply chains, we're in global economic panic territory.

One of the primary objectives of a vigorous public health authority response to an emerging pandemic is to keep supply chains operating. That does not seem to be happening anywhere. The WHO has still not declared a global public health emergency, presumably under pressure from the PRC. Countries with big coronavirus clusters are going from zero intervention to border closures and army mobilization in a matter of days. The scale of disruption to global trade will only grow as more and more governments take measures to mitigate the spread of coronavirus.

Authorities are in the position of dealing with two parallel pandemics, Wuhan coronavirus and quarantine fever. Controlling the first and the second in lockstep will be a fairly heavy lift for the most capable governments. Does anybody who has been watching this develop still think that the People's Republic fits that bill?
