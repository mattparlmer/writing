# From the desk of Matt Parlmer

This repo is a place for things I've written about technology, politics, and
more. Most of it can be found [elsewhere](http://mattparlmer.com), but for
redundancy's sake it's worth having a version-controlled repository as well.

I'm always interested in feedback, feel free to get in touch at
`matt (at) mattparlmer (dot) com` or `matt (at) ohlogen (dot) com` if you
have thoughts on something I've written here or elsewhere.
